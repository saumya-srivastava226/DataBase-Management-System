Schema is not the same as database.
Database is what actually stores data whereas schema is just the structural view of that data.
A SCHEMA is the blueprint or an architecture of exactly how our data will look. 

Que- Describe the architecture of schema?
Ans- It has three layers : a. Physical layer
                           b. Conceptual layer
                           c. External layer
    Physical layers : talks about the physical storage of data.Has access paths of all data. Eg- Physical Data Model
    Conceptual layer: talks about the structure of data.It hides the physical layer. Describes the entities,the data types, the relationships between enetities.
    External layer: provides access control. Diffrenet info is viewed to diff users from same dataset.We can have mutliple external layers.
    
    
Que- What is Data Independence?
Ans-It is the property of modifying one level of schema without affeting other levels.

We have two types of independence- Physical and Logical/Conceptual Independence

Que-ER-Model
Ans-ER- model is a blueprint of a database. It shows the relation bewteen entities.
