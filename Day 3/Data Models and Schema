Learnt about three types of data models. These three are built on top of each other.
First Conceptual Data Model is built , then Representation and then Physical Data Model.

Conceptual Data Models- 
It talks about WHAT aspect of databases.
WHAT---
a. is that you are going to build
b. what kind of data is being used
c. certain contraints
Example- ER-Diagrams

Representational Data Models: It talks about HOW aspect of the data model.
It is a logical structure of database.
How are we going to organize data? What will be the size and type of data?
This step helps us in designing database before actually implementing it.
Example: Relational Data Model


Physical Data Models:This is where we actually store data.
Talks about which database is going to be used?
Which version of DBMS is used?Type of database being used?


Que- Data Modelling helps in achieving Abstraction?
Ans-True 

Que- Which of the following model tells us how data will be on the disk?
Ans- Physical data model

We have covered a few thing about Database Schema as well. Schema is actually the logical representation of data inside database. It is the structural view of data inside database.
