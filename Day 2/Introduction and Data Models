Que- Why do we use dbms?
Ans- Because it provides us data integrity. The data can be stored at one location and shared to diffrent clients based on access privilage.
     Data Sharing- Same information is visible to everyone.
     Data Consistency- If one seat is booked, it will get reflect back to another user trying to book the ticket from same system
     
  Drawbacks of Databases: 
  1. Costly
  2. Comlexity
  3. Trained people are required.
  
Que- Diffrent of client-server architecture
Ans - There are three types of achictectures:
      Tier 1: Client and server recides on the same machine. 
      Tier 2: Client recides on one machine and Server & Database on another machine.
      Tier 3: Client, Server and Database recides on three diffrent machines. A request has to be made to server to access database.


Another thing that I learned Data Models:
Can any type of data be stored in any type of database? No
We have to process the data and decide what kind of database be used for specific data. This is doen with the help of data models.
There are three layers of data models . Conceptual,Representation, and Physical

Conceptual Data Model: The most high level data model. It is very abstract and far away from real database. It answers all the WHAT questions.
